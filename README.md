4. What is the MVP scope? (core features you must get working)
I hope to create a  journal app that allows a user to relief whatever’s on their mind and put it on paper, in this case my app. Will have a date and input field such as a form and then the user should be able to save and retrieve that input from a Database. Each input will be somewhat of a schema and they will be in a Database collection. Currently it has a functional back end. I've tested it with Postman. I now need to build out my front end using React.

CSS, Full CRUD Functionality, Sticking to the Scope and getting functionality. I want to use this opportunity to combine a few concepts to create this App. React is also my most diffiuclt challenge. I want to improve my skills in React.

Definitely CSS, React, Full CRUD Functionality and Authentication. Maybe implement a live music background as well. Wish me Luck and Goodluck to Everyone.
